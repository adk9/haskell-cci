This repository contains Haskell bindings for the CCI library.

See COPYING for license information.

CCI API:

Please use the verbs branch if you want to test the bindings over InfiniBand.

The cabal file in the verbs branch builds ORNL CCI implementation statically.


== Building ==

cabal configure -f examples

cabal build

# to generate documentation
cabal install # fixes error "cabal: Can't find deps for haddock" which would
              # otherwise happen when running "cabal haddock".
cabal haddock


== Running pingpong ==

# Create config file
cat > cci.ini
[Infiniband]
driver=verbs
mss=1024
hca_id = mlx4_0


# or for using UDP sockets:
cat > cci.ini
[eth0]
driver = sock
# replace with your device ip address
ip = 192.168.0.1
# replace with your device mac address
mac = 00:e0:7d:ad:95:5e
default = 1


# Start the server
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -s

# Start the client using rma transfers upto 4 MB.
CCI_CONFIG=../cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h verbs://10.155.90.13:46188 -r 4194304
