This repository contains Haskell bindings for the CCI library.

See COPYING for license information.

CCI API:
  https://parsci.assembla.com/code/cci-haskell/git/nodes/master/Network/CCI.hsc


== Building cci ==

# Install latest cci first. You can get it from:
http://cci-forum.com/

# Then build the bindings:
cabal configure -f "examples tests"
cabal build

# If CCI is not in a standard folder:
cabal configure -f "examples tests" --extra-lib-dirs=/path/to/cci/lib/folder \
                               --extra-include-dirs=/path/to/cci/include/folder
cabal build

# Then programs can be run with
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cci/lib/folder some_program


# to generate documentation
cabal haddock


== Running pingpong ==

# Start the server
dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -s
  Opened ip://192.168.0.1:46188
  ...

# Start the client using rma transfers upto 4 MB.
dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h ip://192.168.0.1:46188 -r 4194304

# Start the client using active messages
dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h ip://192.168.0.1:46188


== Running tests ==

In short:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cci/lib dist/build/test-cci/test-cci

See test/README for details.

== Design notes ==

See design.txt.
