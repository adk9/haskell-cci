== Building cci ==

# Install the 0.1a1 release of cci first. You'll have to request it at:
http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface/
# or via the mailing list:
http://lists.cci-forum.com/listinfo.cgi/cci-users-cci-forum.com

cabal configure -f "examples tests"

cabal build

# to generate documentation
cabal install # fixes error "cabal: Can't find deps for haddock" which would
              # otherwise happen when running "cabal haddock".
cabal haddock


== Running pingpong using UDP sockets ==

# Create a config file for using UDP sockets:
cat > cci.ini
[eth0]
driver = sock
# replace with your device ip address
ip = 192.168.0.1
# replace with your device mac address
mac = 00:e0:7d:ad:95:5e
default = 1


# Start the server
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -s
  Opened ip://192.168.0.1:46188
  ...

# Start the client using rma transfers upto 4 MB.
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h ip://192.168.0.1:46188 -r 4194304

# Start the client using active messages
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h ip://192.168.0.1:46188


== Building cci statically ==

This procedure builds cci statically due to some issues we had in
the past when making ORNL CCI into a shared library. These issues have
been solved now, but we keep the procedure just in case.

This built can use only one driver. You can pass either static-verbs
below if you want to use the verbs driver, or static-sock if you want
to use the sock driver instead. No other drivers are possible to use
this way.

# Get ORNL CCI 0.1a1 release.
# For parsci folks, this can be achieved by issuing:
git clone git@git.assembla.com:cci-ornl.git cci

# For the rest of the world, you have to request access to a recent copy of the 
# cci library to ORNL:
http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface/
# or via the mailing list:
http://lists.cci-forum.com/listinfo.cgi/cci-users-cci-forum.com


cabal configure -f "examples tests static-verbs"

cabal build


== Running pingpong ==

# Create a config file for using the verbs driver:
cat > cci.ini
[Infiniband]
driver=verbs
mss=1024
hca_id = mlx4_0

# Start the server
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -s
  Opened verbs://10.155.90.13:46188
  ...

# Start the client using rma transfers upto 4 MB.
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h verbs://10.155.90.13:46188 -r 4194304

# Start the client using active messages
CCI_CONFIG=cci.ini dist/build/ex-pingpong/ex-pingpong -h verbs://10.155.90.13:46188
