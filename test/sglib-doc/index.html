<h3>1.) What is it about?</H3> 

Sglib is a library defining useful macros for manipulating common
data structures. 
The library currently provides generic implementation for:
<ul>
<li> sorting arrays
<li> manipulating linked lists
<li> manipulating sorted linked lists
<li> manipulating double linked lists
<li> manipulating red-black trees
<li> manipulating hashed containers
</ul>

A basic set of functions (macros) is provided for each data structure.
They cover insertion, deletion, search and iterator traversal of
elements.  Moreover, additional (specific) functions are provided for
each data structure, such as, concatenation, reverse or sort for
lists.

<p> Sglib provides algorithms, not data structures. Algorithms
implemented in Sglib operate on user's types, for example, list macros
are operational for any data structure containing a pointer to the
same type.

<p>
Sglib consists of a single header file without any binary code. In
order to use it just put <code>#include "sglib.h"</code> into your
source code.

<p>
The library is implemented in the C programming language and written
for C programmers, however it is freely inspired by the Standard
Template Library.

<p>
Although I wish to keep the library as simple as possible all 
suggestions for new functionalities are welcomed. Currently, the
implementation of queues, priority queues, hashed tables and AVL 
trees is in progress.



<br><br>
<h3>2.) Why is it different from existing C libraries?</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<h4>Sglib is general.</h4>

Sglib does not require its own data structures.  You do not need to
design your program to be used with Sglib from the beginning. You can
start using Sglib at any stage of the development of your project with
your existing data types.

<p>
For example, let's suppose that you have a program working on a list of
historical events represented by the structure:

<pre>
struct event {
&nbsp;&nbsp;int time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;char *title;
&nbsp;&nbsp;char *description;
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct category *category;
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct event *nextEvent;
};
</pre>

Let's suppose that you have a list of such events ordered by
<code>time</code>.  You are supposed to insert a new event to such
list. First, you need to define a <em>comparator</em>. A comparator is
a macro or function returning respectively a positive, negative or
zero value for cases when the first parameter is greater, less or
equal to the second. For example, the following macro is the
comparator we need:

<pre>
#define CMP_EVENT(x,y) (x->time - y->time)
</pre>

Now you can insert a new event into the list (while keeping the list sorted) 
with the following code:

<pre>
<b>SGLIB_SORTED_LIST_ADD(struct event, theList, newEvent, CMP_EVENT, nextEvent);</b>
</pre>

This macro is expanded into a code inserting the <code>newEvent</code>
onto the right place of <code>theList</code>. 

<p> 
Note that the macro is also parameterized by the type of the list,
the comparator used to order elements and by the name of the field
pointing to the next element of the list.  In consequence, the macro
is very general and usable in nearly any circumstances.





<li>
<h4>Sglib is generic.</h4>

Sglib is generic in the sense that each functionality is parametrized
by the type on which it operates. It defines algorithms independent on
types.  In C++ this can be done easily using templates, in C this is
achieved with the preprocessor.  Preprocessor does not matter whether
macro parameters are types or values.  However, because the
preprocessor is purely textual and does not respect the underlying
programming language, an additional effort is required to prevent
macros from a misuse.

<p>
For example, let's take 
a program defining an array of two-dimensional points represented by their coordinates.
The corresponding definition in C is:

<pre>
struct point {
&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;
&nbsp;&nbsp; int y;
} thePointArray[SIZE];
</pre>

and a macro defining lexicographical ordering on points:

<pre>
#define CMP_POINT(p1,p2) ((p1.x!=p2.x)?(p1.x-p2.x):(p1.y-p2.y))
</pre>

In such case the following line of code is sorting the array using heap sort:

<pre>
  <b>SGLIB_ARRAY_SINGLE_HEAP_SORT(struct point, thePointArray, SIZE, CMP_POINT);</b>
</pre>

Note that no pointers are involved in this implementation.





<li>
<h4>Sglib is fast.</h4>


Sglib operates directly on your data structures. It does not require
an additional pointer stored in its internal data representation. 
It does not contain any allocations and freeing of internal data structures
neither.
Moreover, macros are expanded in compile time saving the overhead
related to function invocations.



<li>
<h4>Sglib is independent on memory management system.</h4>

Sglib does not create/allocate or destruct/free any datas. It only
manipulates them. For example, macros manipulating balanced trees are
exclusively modifiying the "left_son" and "right_son" (or whatever
names user chooses) fields of allocated cells.  In consequence, Sglib
is absolutely independent on any memory management system.  It never
calls <code>malloc</code> or similar function.  It is perfectly usable
in projects requiring high discipline in memory allocation.




<li>
<h4>Sglib is safe.</h4>

Macros are known as being source of bugs because
macro parameters may be evaluated several times and
symbols inside parameters are resolved in the scope where parameters are used, not
in the scope where the macro is invoked. For example, let's take the macro:
<pre>
#define LIST_LEN(type, list, result) {\\
  int i;\\
  type l;\\
  for(i=0,l=list; l!=NULL; l=l->next, i++) ;\\
  result = i;\\
}
</pre>
invoked in the situation:
<pre>
int ilistlen(ilist *l) {
  int res;
  LIST_LEN(ilist, l, res);
  return(res);
}
</pre>
Here, the symbol <code>l</code> in the line <code>LIST_LEN(struct ilist, l, res);</code> is logically 
expected to be resolved to the formal parameter of the function <code>ilistlen</code>. However
in reality it is resolved to the local variable <code>l</code>
defined by the line <code>type l;\</code> inside the macro. This usually provokes compiler to 
complain about a use of an uninitialized variable.

<p>
Sglib offers two mechanisms to avoid such problems. 
<ul>
<li>First, Sglib is using particular naming conventions.
All variables defined inside macros begins and ends with <code>_</code> (underscore).
As it is unusual to use such names in normal code this reduces the risk of conflicts. The above macro
computing length of a list would be implemented as:

<pre>
#define LIST_LEN(type, list, result) { \\
  int _i_; \\
  type _l_; \\
  for(_i_=0,_l_=(list); _l_!=NULL; _l_=_l_->next, _i_++) ; \\
  (result) = _i_; \\
}
</pre>


<li>
Second,
Sglib offers all its functionalities not only in form of macros, but also in form of standard C functions.

<p>
Internally we call macros as a 
<em>level - 0</em> user interface and functions as a <em>level - 1</em> user
interface. The <em>level - 1</em> interface provides legal C functions for each particular
type and those functions can be called from the main program without
worrying about unwanted effects due to macro expansions.

<p>
The <em>level - 1</em> interface in praxis means, that you invoke one large
macro at the beginning of your program. This macro is parametrized by the type 
and it generates all available functions for this type. Names of those functions
will be composed from the prefix <code>sglib_</code> followed by the name of your type
and finishing by the name of the operation they implement.

<p>
For example the invocation:
<pre>
<b>SGLIB_DEFINE_SORTED_LIST_FUNCTIONS(ilist, ilist_comparator, next)</b>
</pre>
is expanded into definitions of functions, such as <code>sglib_ilist_len, sglib_ilist_sort, sglib_ilist_add, sglib_ilist_delete</code>, etc. Those functions take parameter of the type 
<code>ilist</code> and they use the function (or macro) <code>ilist_comparator</code>
to compare elements. You can use those functions without worrying about
macro expansions. For example, the above function computing the length of a list would be:
<pre>
int ilistlen(ilist *l) {
  int res;
  res = sglib_ilist_len(l);
  return(res);
}
</pre>

Note that there is practically no danger of conflicts when invoking the <code>SGLIB_DEFINE_SORTED_LIST_FUNCTIONS</code>
macro, because this macro is invoked in the top level scope and because it is using exclusively non-expression
parameters.

</ul>



</ul>

<h3>3.) Why to do it?</H3> 

Everyone knows that the C preprocessor can be used to
imitate genericity of other languages
and everyone consider this idea dangerous and ugly.
I don't. With experiences in my programming praxis I used macros parametrized
by types more and more often. Finally, I realized that I need
a really general and well designed generic library. 
After a research on the Internet I have found only <code>sys/queue.h</code> header which
was far from what I needed. 
I was surprised that after 30 years
of the existence of the C language, in the era of the Internet
when everyone is doing everything for anybody, nobody
have written such library. 
Even if I believed that one day I would find somewhere
a similar library yet done, I decided to invest my time
into creation of the Sglib. I have started by collecting all
macros that I have written for <a href="http://www.xref-tech.com/xrefactory/main.html">Xrefactory</a> 
giving them a uniform face.

<p>
In opposition to many cake eaters from my university,
I believe that ideas behind Sglib are good because of my former research on modern (and generic)
programming languages and because of my current work on a refactoring browser
for C. From previous works I know that many generic
constructions are implemented via some form of preprocessor.  When
working on the C refactoring browser I have written my own
C preprocessor. During this work I have
realized how much the preprocessor is standardized and how precisely
it is defined in the current ANSI standard. Hence, even very advanced 
(you may say strange) preprocessor constructions are perfectly portable 
through compilers implementing ANSI standard.
